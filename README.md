You go onto [twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv/), your usual streamers are not there, or you have not found one you like yet, you keep on aimlessly clicking to find the one streamer to waste your time on. Not any more! `ryck.py` aims to automate this process for you! Run it, and streams will start flowing! With the press of a single key you go to the next. Sounds good? Then head over to [ryck on gitlab](https://gitlab.com/johanbluecreek/ryck) where it will be maintained in the future.
